# A decentralized escrow protocol makes it easy for people who don't trust each other to make safe payments. The Eskro protocol is used. Before a transaction can be made, tokens are sent to an escrow, which is a third-party smart contract. The escrow holds the tokens until the conditions for payment are met. Both the agreed-upon product or service and the agreed-upon payment must be made by all parties involved in the transaction. One party shouldn't be able to back out of a deal at the other party's expense. If the payment terms depend on outside information, like when a product is shipped, the oracle pattern can be used to give the escrow the information it needs. As soon as the smart contract code is put on the blockchain, it can't be changed. This makes sure that the escrow functionality is safe. This gives everyone involved in the trade the peace of mind that they won't be taken advantage of.
